# Time-Contrastive Networks

An pytorch implementation a time-contrastive networks model as presented in the paper "Time-Contrastive Networks: Self-Supervised Learning from Multi-View Observation" (Sermanet Et al. 2017).

Only training from single view observations has been implemented. Videos are added to the `data/train` and `data/validation` directories.

Training the model is done by running the `train_tcn.py` script.
